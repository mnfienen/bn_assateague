Subject:	Netica 64-bit working!
Here are some instructions that should get netica's 64-bit DLLs working on your machines.
This will allow you to start matlab ANYWHERE and run the netica stuff ANYWHERE.
The problem was matlab, which would not add dlls and libs to long paths and windows needed to know where the dlls were too.

At your convenience, please do the following and let me know if it works.  Requires REBOOT as well as exiting matlab. Please make sure to comment out other netica references in librarypath and classpath.  

% CREATE a local neticabin directory
mkdir C:\neticabin64b
% COPY following files to your local drive from
% \\stplidar01\processed1\programs\matlab_programs\bayesTools\NeticaJ408_64bit\
Netica.dll
NeticaJ.lib                   
NeticaJ.dll
NeticaJ.jar

% include in classpath.txt
C:\neticabin64b
C:\neticabin64b\NeticaJ.jar
% include in librarypath.txt
C:\neticabin64b
% include in windows system environment variable PATH (append to path, preceed with ;)
C:\neticabin64b;

% REBOOT COMPUTER (matlab also restarts)

% test
import norsys.netica.*;
env = Environ.getDefaultEnviron;
env = Environ('+PlantN/USGS/120-4/12690');
% ok?
env.finalize
